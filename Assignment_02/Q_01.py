# Add two numbers

# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:


# Prompt the user to enter the first number.

num1  = input("enter your  1st number")
# Read the input and convert it to an integer.
 
read_num1  = int(num1)
# Prompt the user to enter the second number.

num2  = input("enter your  2nd number")
# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

read_num2  = int(num2)
# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

num_result = read_num1 + read_num2

# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.2
print(f'input 1 is {read_num1} and  input 2 is {read_num2}  both are sum ={num_result}')
